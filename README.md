NBA Statistics Analyzer

The purpose of this project is to build a full stack data analysis application that gather NBA players statistics and make prediction about the players future performance.  Other than the conventional NBA player data (points, assists, rebounds etc...) we will gather other players statistics such as number of slam dunks, average speed, average distance etc... and analyze patterns and make conclusions about players' outlook.

Data sources:
